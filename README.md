# Placement-Management_System_using_Certificate_authenticator
Motive of this project is streamline placement process, improve efficiency, and enhance the experience for students and companies.

- Project aims to overcome challenges faced in managing placement processes manually, such as slow operations. To overcome these issues, we propose a web-based placement management system that efficiently manages student information related to placements in college.
- The system allows students to log in and upload their personal and educational information, eliminating the need for repetitive registrations. One of the key features is the Certificate Authenticator, ensuring integrity of the uploaded documents.
- To facilitate the recruitment process, the system enables companies to log in and view student resumes selectively. They can filter profiles based on their specific requirements, such as qualification and year of study. 
- Additionally, the system provides an administrator module to manage job details of placed students.
Technologies such as Java, MySQL, JDBC, and Spring are utilized to develop this project. Java provides a robust programming language, while MySQL serves as the database management system. JDBC allows seamless connectivity between the Java application and the database, enabling efficient data retrieval and storage. 
- Spring framework provides support for building scalable and maintainable web applications.
